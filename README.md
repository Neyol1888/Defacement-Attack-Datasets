# README: Defacement Attack Dataset

## Overview
The **Defacement Attack Dataset** is designed to support research and analysis on web defacement attacks. It contains structured data detailing various features relevant to identifying and understanding defacement incidents, which can be utilized for tasks such as machine learning, exploratory data analysis, and cybersecurity risk assessment.

## File Information
- **File Name**: DefacementAttackDataset.csv
- **Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Size**: 0.47 MB
- **Rows**: 3400
- **Columns**: 18

## Contents
The dataset includes the following columns:

1. **User ID**: Unique identifier for the user account.
2. **Username**: The name associated with the user account.
3. **Account Status**: The status of the user account (e.g., Active, Compromised, Suspended).
4. **Followers Count**: The number of followers the user account has.
5. **Post ID**: Unique identifier for the post affected by defacement.
6. **Content Before Defacement**: The original content of the post before defacement.
7. **Content After Defacement**: The altered content of the post after defacement.
8. **Post Timestamp**: The timestamp when the post was originally published.
9. **Defacement Method**: The method used for the defacement (e.g., Social Engineering, Cross-site Scripting).
10. **Type of Attack**: The type of attack executed (e.g., Impersonation, Account Hijacking, XSS).
11. **IP Address**: The IP address associated with the defacement activity.
12. **Location**: The geographical location associated with the defacement activity.
13. **Device Information**: Information about the device used during the defacement.
14. **Time of Defacement**: The timestamp when the defacement occurred.
15. **Time of Detection**: The timestamp when the defacement was detected.
16. **Time of Recovery**: The timestamp when the content was restored or mitigated.
17. **Action Taken**: The response action taken (e.g., Content Removed, Password Reset).
18. **Restoration Status**: The restoration status of the content (e.g., Restored, Not Restored).

## Usage
This dataset is intended for:

- **Cybersecurity Research**: Analyzing patterns in defacement attacks.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Training and testing algorithms for detecting or preventing web defacement incidents.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Gaining insights into the nature and characteristics of defacement attacks.
